## Code Style

*   We use **TypeScript** and **React**. Please ensure your code is typed correctly.
*   We use **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Avoid writing custom CSS in `index.html` unless absolutely necessary.
*   Keep components small and reusable.
*   **Icons:** Use SVG components rather than importing image files when possible to allow for dynamic styling (like the `SentimentIcon.tsx`).
